### Changing the topology across all layers of the CNNs: ###
Basic experiments, tracking the transformation of topological descriptors (Lifespans) and Persistent Homological fractal dimension (PHdim) throughout the depth of convolutional neural networks. The calculations were performed using the [Ripser](https://github.com/scikit-tda/ripser.py) package for fast computation of persistent diagrams for TDA tasks.
+ --net: [Resnet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVyVUw1Qa1ScZUmWLgj0uUEyLJm6i8Vb/view?usp=sharing) or [VGG](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNnQbdztBPkvAjqLx9N6QazKCW3Y4nxV/view?usp=sharing) (download it from google drive)
+ --mode: Topology (Topological descriptors of data) or PHdim (Persistent Homological fractal dimension)
+ --path: 'path/to/tensorflow_model_name.h5'

```
python Experiments.py --net VGG --mode PHdim --path 'path/to/model.h5'
```

the experimental results in -net VGG case will be approximately as follows

### Predicting generalization ability of CNNs: ###
Reproduction and verification of experiments on assessing the generalizing ability of CNN by extracting topological descriptors of the training dataset manifold from the internal representation of neural networks. Download the [Resnet models dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1que2h8aQGg6sagtkEdm46vubhHIWDKPr/view?usp=sharing) and unzip to dir:

+ --path: path to dataset dir
+ --homdim: dimension of homology group: 0 or 1

```
python generalization.py --path 'path/to/dir_models_dataset' --homdim 0
```

### Adversarial manifold: ###
Adversarial examples were generated by the FGSM method using the [Cleverhans](https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/cleverhans) library. In the process of going through all the layers and transforming the data, the topology of the manifold of the dataset changed. It can be seen that the more successful the targeted attack is, the simpler the data topology (color palette from black to white), which is confirmed by experimental results. The experiments were carried out on a our [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1epigNlWVSD2i8yIb7488OBIxT6CGj7We/view?usp=sharing) (download it from google drive) of generated images from all categories of buildings in the ImageNet, using the [MobileNetV2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19GYB94xN_WWoRvsgJMPAK9mQPqZHSMWU/view?usp=sharing) model (download it from google drive). Different attack success was achieved by changing epsilon. You can reproduce and check the results as follows:

+ --data: path to dataset file_name.pkl
+ --model: path to model_name.h5'
+ --homdim: dimension of homology group: 0 or 1

```
python Adversarial.py --data 'path/to/Buildings_dataset.pkl' --model 'path/to/MobileNetv2_model.h5' --homdim 1
```

The [Large Crowdcollected Facial Anti-Spoofing Dataset](https://github.com/IDRnD/LCC_FASD) was used to estimate the Persistent Homological fractal dimension of spoofing attacks and faces.
